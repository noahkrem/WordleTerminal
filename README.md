# Wordle Terminal

This is a simple wordle game that can be run in the terminal. I'd like to credit the Replit YouTube channel for the inspiration for this project.

## Imports

In order to install the necessary 'termcolor', execute the following line in the terminal:

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">python3 -m pip install --upgrade termcolor</span>
